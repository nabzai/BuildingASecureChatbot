LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency

This bot has no autonomous "Agent" Capabilities - GPT3.5 is used and can only generate text responses
The LLM can produce text but can not initiate any actions.
The LLM has no delegated authority beyond generating text.

subprocess.run is only used for 1password API key retrieval, LLM has no control over it.

Manual interaction loop. no second level calls or letting the LLM chose what to do next
no advanced tool usage functionality



Excessive agency comes into play when:
    LLM can run commands ex - capture output and pass it to subprocess.run() or any other system level calls - 
    this would give the LLM the ability to execute code

    LLM can run plugins (LangChain, LlamaIndex or any plugins that let the LLM read/write files, fetch URLs, 
    or query Databases)
        without proper permissions this could be destructive and result in unintended consequences


    LLM Can expose Sensitive Data or Operations
