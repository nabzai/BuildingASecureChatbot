LLM08:2025 - Vector Embedding Weakness


A no use of vector embeddings or stores.
code strictly uses client.chat.completions.create from LLM GPT3.5 turbo
No storing or retrieval of user queries

Some variables for consideration:

What data is used to generate vector embeddings (public, proprietary, sensitive or other generated?)

How are the embeddings created? (proprietary, open-source, third-party API ex OpenAIâ€™s embeddings)?

Are embeddings stored? If So where? How?

Are there known biases or inaccuracies in the embedding model?

Who has access to the embeddings?

Are the embeddings shared with 3rd-parties?

Are there controls to prevent un-authorized access to embedding data?

Could embeddings leak sensitive data (ex PII?)

Is there monitoring for Anomalous Embedding behavior?

Are there safeguards against embedding-based attacks like prompt injection?

How are embeddings used downstream? (search, recommendations, decision making)

Do embeddings comply with GDPR, PIPL and other relevant privacy regulations?

Is there an audit trail for embedding generation and usage?

Have embeddings been tested for ethical risks?

Who is responsible for monitoring and addressing Embedding based risks?
